## Code:

This JavaScript code powers the web application, enabling users to add, edit, and delete flashcards. Upon submitting the flashcard creation form, it sends a JSON object to the server via a POST request. The application dynamically generates HTML elements for each flashcard, provides editing options, and fetches existing flashcards from the server on page load.
